# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description
This project displays images fetched from the Picsum Photos API. 
It provides an interface for users to view images, with options to save them to a database or local storage. 
Additionally, the project includes a feature to zoom in on images within a modal window for closer inspection.

## Usage
1. Start the application (backend): `npm start`
2. Start the application (frontend): `npm run dev`
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/`
